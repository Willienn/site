      Willien: Web Developer & Creative Mind Hailing from Caldas Novas, Brazil,
      Willien's inquisitive nature sparked a love for programming at 18. Now 22,
      he brings two years of experience from a local startup to his web
      development skills. While managing his time with ADHD can be a challenge,
      Willien's passion for web development remains strong. He recently
      celebrated a personal victory by conquering his anxieties and launching
      his YouTube channel with a video. This achievement, a testament to his
      dedication, showcases his creative spark that extends to video editing,
      photography, and drawing. Willien is skilled in React, Next.js, Tailwind,
      and Chakra UI, and his sights are set on mastering Three.js (mention
      specific libraries like Three.js/Fiber and React-Three-UIkit only if
      highly relevant to potential opportunities). He's currently open to
      freelance web development projects and welcomes exciting new work
      opportunities.
